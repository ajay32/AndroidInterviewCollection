//In OAuth, which is commonly used for authorization in web and mobile applications, there are typically two types of tokens involved: **Auth Tokens (Access Tokens)** and **Refresh Tokens**. Both are crucial for managing user sessions securely but serve distinct purposes:
//
//### Auth Token (Access Token)
//
//- **Purpose**: The Auth Token, or Access Token, is used to grant access to a secured resource, like an API. It acts as proof that the user has been authenticated and authorized to access certain resources.
//- **Lifetime**: Access Tokens are usually short-lived. They typically expire after a brief period, from an hour to a day, depending on the security requirements of the service.
//- **Usage**: Each time a request is made to the resource server, the Access Token must be included, usually in the HTTP Authorization header. This token lets the server know that the request is authorized.
//- **Security**: Due to its short lifespan, the impact of an Access Token being compromised is limited (although still critical).
//
//### Refresh Token
//
//- **Purpose**: The Refresh Token is used to obtain a new Access Token when the current Access Token expires, without requiring the user to go through the full authentication process again.
//- **Lifetime**: Refresh Tokens can be long-lived. They are designed to last for days, weeks, or even months unless explicitly revoked. This duration often depends on the user's activity or security policies of the service.
//- **Usage**: When the Access Token expires, the application can use the Refresh Token to request a new Access Token from the authorization server. This process happens in the background, providing a seamless experience for the user.
//- **Security**: Because they are long-lived, Refresh Tokens require careful protection. If a Refresh Token is leaked, it can potentially provide prolonged unauthorized access until it is revoked.
//
//### Key Differences
//
//1. **Validity Duration**: Access Tokens have a short lifespan, while Refresh Tokens usually last much longer.
//2. **Purpose in Authentication Flow**: Access Tokens are used for accessing protected resources, while Refresh Tokens are used to safely renew Access Tokens without repeated logins.
//3. **Security Risk**: Compromise of an Access Token risks unauthorized access for a short period, whereas compromise of a Refresh Token can risk access for a much longer duration.
//
//In summary, while both tokens are integral to the OAuth flow, they handle different aspects of user session and security management. Access Tokens facilitate active session security, and Refresh Tokens help maintain user sessions over longer periods without compromising security through repeated user logins.
