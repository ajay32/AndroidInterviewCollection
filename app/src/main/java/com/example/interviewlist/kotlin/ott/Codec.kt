//In the realm of digital video and streaming media, "codecs" are software or hardware tools that compress (encode) and decompress (decode) digital video and audio data. The term "codec" is a portmanteau of "encoder" and "decoder." Here's a look at some of the most common codecs used in OTT platforms and digital media in general:
//
//### 1. **H.264 (AVC)**
//- **Full Name**: Advanced Video Coding
//- **Use Case**: H.264 is one of the most widely used video codecs for recording, compression, and distribution of video content. It is highly efficient, offering good video quality at substantially lower bit rates than previous standards (like MPEG-2), which makes it ideal for network and Internet streaming (OTT).
//- **Compatibility**: H.264 is supported across almost all platforms, devices, and browsers.
//
//### 2. **H.265 (HEVC)**
//- **Full Name**: High Efficiency Video Coding
//- **Use Case**: H.265 is the successor to H.264 and offers approximately double the data compression ratio at the same level of video quality, or substantially improved video quality at the same bit rate. It's particularly effective for 4K and higher resolutions.
//- **Compatibility**: HEVC is gaining support on newer devices and platforms, particularly where 4K content is being distributed, but its adoption is hindered by higher royalty and licensing costs compared to H.264.
//
//### 3. **VP9**
//- **Developed By**: Google
//- **Use Case**: VP9 is an open and royalty-free video coding format developed as a successor to VP8. Google uses it extensively for YouTube streaming. It offers better compression than H.264 and is comparable to H.265, making it well-suited for high-definition streaming scenarios.
//- **Compatibility**: Supported mainly on platforms that are compatible with Google's technologies, including Android devices, Chrome, and some other browsers like Firefox.
//
//### 4. **AV1**
//- **Developed By**: Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia)
//- **Use Case**: AV1 is a cutting-edge, open, and royalty-free video codec designed to transmit high-quality video over the internet efficiently. It is intended to be more efficient than HEVC and free from the patent limitations that affect other codecs. AV1 aims to be the future standard for 4K and higher resolutions in streaming media.
//- **Compatibility**: Support for AV1 is growing but is currently more limited due to its relatively new status and the computational intensity required to encode and decode videos.
//
//### 5. **VP8**
//- **Developed By**: Google
//- **Use Case**: VP8 is an open video compression format and codec that predates VP9. It's used primarily for lower-resolution streaming where bandwidth limitations are strict, though its use is largely being superseded by newer codecs.
//- **Compatibility**: It enjoys broad support particularly where legacy support is needed and is still used in some WebRTC applications.
//
//### 6. **MPEG-2**
//- **Full Name**: Moving Picture Experts Group 2
//- **Use Case**: MPEG-2 is widely used as the format of digital television signals that are broadcast by terrestrial (over-the-air), cable, and direct broadcast satellite TV systems. It is also used for the compression of DVDs.
//- **Compatibility**: Very broad compatibility across older digital TV systems and DVDs, though it is not efficient enough for modern internet streaming standards due to its higher bandwidth needs.
//
//### 7. **MPEG-4**
//- **Full Name**: Moving Picture Experts Group 4
//- **Use Case**: MPEG-4 is a broad standard that encompasses a variety of audio and video codecs, including advanced video coding (AVC) formats like H.264. It is used for video conferencing, streaming media, and broadcasting.
//- **Compatibility**: Widely supported across many platforms and devices, though specific support can vary based on the exact profile and level being used.
//
//### Conclusion
//Choosing the right codec depends on factors like content type, required quality, compatibility requirements, available bandwidth, and licensing costs. For OTT platforms, balancing these factors is crucial to deliver the best user experience while managing costs and maintaining broad device support.

// Android specfic codecs

//In Android apps, video playback support depends on the device's hardware and software capabilities, which can vary significantly across different devices and Android versions. However, Android's multimedia framework, which includes `ExoPlayer` and Android's built-in `MediaPlayer`, supports a variety of audio and video codecs.
//
//Here is a breakdown of commonly supported codecs for video and audio playback in Android apps:
//
//### Video Codecs:
//1. **H.264/AVC (Advanced Video Coding)**
//- **Support Level**: Widely supported across all Android devices. It is the most common video codec for recording and playback due to its balance of high quality and compression efficiency.
//
//2. **H.265/HEVC (High Efficiency Video Coding)**
//- **Support Level**: Support is variable and more common on newer and higher-end devices. It offers better compression than H.264, which is beneficial for high-resolution videos like 4K.
//
//3. **VP8**
//- **Support Level**: Widely supported on Android devices, often used for video streaming and WebRTC applications.
//
//4. **VP9**
//- **Support Level**: Increasingly supported on newer Android devices, especially useful for high-definition YouTube streaming.
//
//5. **AV1**
//- **Support Level**: Support is growing but still mostly limited to newer and higher-end devices due to its demanding decoding requirements. AV1 is designed to be a future-proof codec offering superior compression efficiency.
//
//### Audio Codecs:
//1. **AAC (Advanced Audio Codec)**
//- **Support Level**: Universally supported across Android devices. It provides higher sound quality than MP3 at similar bit rates and is the standard for video files.
//
//2. **MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer III)**
//- **Support Level**: Universally supported and widely used for audio streaming and media playback.
//
//3. **Opus**
//- **Support Level**: Supported especially in applications using WebRTC for real-time communications. It's known for its low latency and high quality, making it ideal for interactive communication applications.
//
//4. **Vorbis**
//- **Support Level**: Commonly supported and often used in conjunction with the VP8 video codec in WebM container formats.
//
//### Tools for Media Playback on Android:
//- **ExoPlayer**: A powerful media player for Android developed by Google. It's more flexible and feature-rich than `MediaPlayer` and supports dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH) and SmoothStreaming, aside from traditional media playback. ExoPlayer is extensible and can be customized to support a wide range of media formats, even beyond what the Android platform supports natively.
//- **MediaPlayer**: Built into Android, supports basic playback capabilities and handles most common media types but might lack the flexibility and features provided by ExoPlayer.
//
//### Development Considerations:
//- **Device Compatibility**: Always consider the variability in hardware support across devices. Testing across a range of devices or using device emulators can help understand codec support and performance.
//- **Licensing and Patents**: Some codecs may require licensing fees or have patent implications (e.g., H.264, H.265). It's essential to be aware of these when choosing codecs for commercial applications.
//- **Performance**: Higher compression codecs like H.265 and AV1 offer bandwidth savings but are more computationally intensive, which could affect battery life and device heat on mobile devices.
//
//For the most current and specific codec support details, it's also good to refer to the official Android documentation or the device specifications from manufacturers, as codec support can change with new Android versions and hardware capabilities.
