// Different modifiers in Kotlin

//In Kotlin, modifiers are keywords that you place before declarations like classes, functions, properties, or other constructs to specify their behavior and interaction with other parts of the code. These modifiers include visibility modifiers, inheritance modifiers, and a few special-purpose modifiers. Understanding each of these can help you effectively structure your Kotlin code.
//
//### Visibility Modifiers
//
//Visibility modifiers determine the visibility of a class, object, interface, constructor, function, property, or setter method in Kotlin. There are four visibility modifiers:
//
//1. **`public`**:
//- **Default**: If no visibility modifier is specified, `public` is used by default.
//- **Accessibility**: Members are visible everywhere within the same module.
//- **Use Case**: Use when you need to make a class or member accessible from any other part of your application or library.
//
//2. **`private`**:
//- **Accessibility**: Members are only visible within the file containing the declaration.
//- **Use Case**: Use for utility functions or data that should not be accessible outside the file where they are declared, typically for internal functionality.
//
//3. **`protected`**:
//- **Accessibility**: Members are visible in the class itself and in subclasses.
//- **Use Case**: Use when you want to hide a member from external use but allow access in subclasses, which is common in class hierarchies to restrict the use of sensitive or subclass-specific functionality.
//
//4. **`internal`**:
//- **Accessibility**: Members are visible everywhere within the same module.
//- **Use Case**: Use when you need to expose members to the entire module but keep them hidden from external modules, useful in large projects to maintain internal APIs.
//
//### Inheritance Modifiers
//
//These modifiers relate to inheritance and the extendability of classes:
//
//1. **`final`**:
//- **Default**: If no inheritance modifier is specified, `final` is used by default for classes.
//- **Behavior**: Prevents the class from being subclassed.
//- **Use Case**: Use when creating a class that should not be extended to maintain strict behavior or security.
//
//2. **`open`**:
//- **Behavior**: Allows the class to be subclassed or a member to be overridden.
//- **Use Case**: Use when you design a class to be a base class or when members are meant to be customizable in subclasses.
//
//3. **`abstract`**:
//- **Behavior**: Cannot instantiate the class directly, and it must have abstract members that need to be implemented by subclasses.
//- **Use Case**: Use in base classes that are intended to provide a common template for subclasses but where direct instantiation does not make sense.
//
//4. **`override`**:
//- **Behavior**: Indicates that a member overrides another member from a superclass.
//- **Use Case**: Use whenever you modify the implementation of an inherited member to change or extend its behavior in a subclass.
//
//### Special-Purpose Modifiers
//
//These include modifiers that control other specific aspects of the code:
//
//1. **`lateinit`**:
//- **Behavior**: Used with mutable properties (`var`) that are not initialized within the constructor but are guaranteed to be initialized before accessing.
//- **Use Case**: Useful for dependencies that are injected after the object is constructed or for properties initialized through setup methods.
//
//2. **`const`**:
//- **Behavior**: Marks a property as a compile-time constant, meaning it can be assigned to a `String` or a primitive type.
//- **Use Case**: Use for properties that are used often and do not change, which can be optimized by the compiler for performance.
//
//3. **`data`**:
//- **Behavior**: Automatically provides generated implementations of `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and `copy()` for a class.
//- **Use Case**: Use for classes that act primarily as data holders and require utility functions like those above for comparisons, cloning, and string representation.
//
//4. **`inline`**:
//- **Behavior**: Indicates that a function or property should be inlined by the compiler, meaning the function body is directly substituted into the place where the function is called.
//- **Use Case**: Typically used for higher-order functions to reduce the overhead of object creation and to increase performance.
//
//These modifiers play a crucial role in Kotlin's ability to produce concise, safe, and maintainable code, aligning with Kotlin's overall goals of being a pragmatic, modern, and statically typed language.
