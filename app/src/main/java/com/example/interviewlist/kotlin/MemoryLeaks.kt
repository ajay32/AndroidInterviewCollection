//Memory leaks in Android occur when objects that are no longer needed are still held in memory because they are being referenced by other objects. These leaks can lead to unnecessary resource consumption and eventually cause the application to crash due to out-of-memory errors.
//
//### Reasons for Memory Leaks in Android
//
//1. **Static Fields**: Static fields can be a common source of memory leaks because their lifecycle is tied to the application, not the activity. If a static field holds a reference to an Activity, this prevents the Activity from being garbage collected even after it has been destroyed.
//
//2. **Listeners and Callbacks**: Objects that register listeners or callbacks without unregistering them can cause memory leaks. For instance, if an Activity registers itself as a listener to a system service or another object and doesn’t unregister before being destroyed, it remains in memory.
//
//3. **Inner Classes**: Non-static inner classes hold an implicit reference to their outer class. If an inner class (like an Adapter or Thread) lives longer than its outer class (like an Activity), it can prevent the outer class from being garbage collected.
//
//4. **Context Leaks**: Holding onto a context longer than necessary, especially the Activity context, can lead to significant memory leaks. For instance, using the Activity context in places where the Application context would suffice, like when instantiating a Singleton that lives throughout the application lifecycle.
//
//5. **Handlers**: If a Handler is not static and contains messages or callbacks that last longer than the Activity, the Activity will not be cleaned up, causing a memory leak.
//
//### Detecting Memory Leaks
//
//1. **Android Studio Profiler**: Use Android Studio's built-in memory profiler to monitor the app’s memory use in real-time. You can take heap dumps, analyze memory allocations, and see which objects are using up memory.
//
//2. **LeakCanary**: A popular open-source library specifically designed to detect memory leaks in Android applications. LeakCanary watches references to your objects and alerts you if they are not properly garbage collected.
//
//### How to Fix Memory Leaks
//
//1. **Remove Static References**: Avoid using static fields for contexts or views. If necessary, make sure to clear these references when they are no longer needed.
//
//2. **Unregister Listeners/Callbacks**: Always unregister callbacks or listeners in the appropriate lifecycle method (`onStop()`, `onDestroy()`, or similar).
//
//3. **Use WeakReferences**: If you need to retain a context or a view within a long-lived object, use a `WeakReference`. A `WeakReference` allows the referenced object to be garbage collected if there are no other strong references to it.
//
//4. **Avoid Non-Static Inner Classes**: Prefer static inner classes and pass necessary references explicitly to avoid leaking their outer class. For threads or runnable, use static classes or better yet, consider using managed threads like those provided by `ExecutorService`.
//
//5. **Proper Use of Handlers**: If using Handlers, make them static and use a `WeakReference` to hold the Activity. Clear any messages or runnables in `onDestroy()`.
//
//6. **Context Awareness**: Use the Application context whenever possible, especially when creating long-lived objects like Singletons. For views and adapters, always use the Activity context to avoid holding onto it after the Activity is destroyed.
//
//### Example of LeakCanary Implementation
//
//To add LeakCanary to your Android project, include it in your `build.gradle` file:
//
//```gradle
//dependencies {
//    debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.7'
//}
//```
//
//LeakCanary will automatically start monitoring your application for memory leaks when the app starts. If a leak is detected, it will notify you with a notification showing a detailed leak trace and potentially the cause of the leak.
//
//Addressing memory leaks is crucial for maintaining good application performance and user experience. Regularly monitoring, testing, and updating your code to handle objects properly can prevent most common leaks.
//

//how leak canary works

//LeakCanary is a popular open-source library used to detect memory leaks in Android applications. It is highly effective in identifying leaks in your app by monitoring the heap for retained objects that are no longer needed but still held in memory. Here’s how LeakCanary works to help you track down and fix memory leaks:
//
//### How LeakCanary Works:
//
//1. **Integration and Setup**:
//- First, you integrate LeakCanary into your Android project by adding it as a dependency in your `build.gradle` file. Once integrated, LeakCanary automatically initializes itself when your application starts. It requires no additional setup from the developer for basic leak detection.
//
//2. **Object Watching**:
//- LeakCanary watches objects that are expected to be garbage collected. When you navigate away from an activity or fragment, LeakCanary retains a weak reference to it and expects this object to be garbage collected soon after.
//
//3. **Heap Analysis**:
//- After a garbage collection event, LeakCanary checks if the watched objects are still retained in memory. If an object is still retained, LeakCanary suspects a memory leak and triggers a heap dump. This heap dump captures all objects in the heap at that moment along with their references.
//- The heap dump file is then analyzed by LeakCanary's heap analyzer in a separate process to prevent overloading the app process.
//
//4. **Leak Detection and Reporting**:
//- The analyzer looks through the heap dump to find the reference chain from the garbage collector roots to the retained objects. By examining these chains, LeakCanary determines whether a leak exists, and if so, identifies the potential causes by showing the reference paths that prevented the objects from being garbage collected.
//- The results are then presented to the developer in the form of a detailed leak report, which includes information about the leaked object, the path to the GC root, and other relevant details. This report is usually shown via a notification that opens a detailed leak analysis screen when tapped.
//
//5. **Exclusions and Filtering**:
//- LeakCanary allows developers to customize which objects to watch and which to ignore. You can configure LeakCanary to ignore known leak patterns or false positives specific to your application or third-party libraries.
//
//### Example Notification:
//When a leak is detected, LeakCanary sends a notification to the developer. Clicking on this notification will show a screen with detailed information about the leak, such as:
//- Class name of the leaked object.
//- A stack trace showing where the object was allocated.
//- The chain of references that prevents the object from being garbage collected, annotated with hints that may explain why each reference is held.
//
//### Benefits of Using LeakCanary:
//- **Ease of Use**: LeakCanary is straightforward to integrate and automatically performs leak detection without needing extensive manual setup.
//- **Early Detection**: It helps developers catch memory leaks during the development phase, long before the app reaches production.
//- **Detail-Oriented**: Provides comprehensive details that are crucial for diagnosing and fixing leaks, including the exact location in code where the leak occurred.
//
//LeakCanary is a powerful tool for maintaining optimal memory usage in Android applications, helping developers improve app performance and stability by catching and fixing memory leaks early in the development cycle.

// code example for it to send notification and initialization

//To integrate LeakCanary into your Android application, perform a series of simple setup steps, and see how you can use it to automatically detect memory leaks and notify you of their occurrence. Here’s a step-by-step guide on adding LeakCanary to your project, initializing it, and viewing notifications about detected leaks.
//
//### Step 1: Add LeakCanary Dependency
//
//First, you need to add the LeakCanary dependency to your `build.gradle` (app module) file. It's a good practice to include this only in your debug builds to avoid impacting your release APK:
//
//```gradle
//dependencies {
//    debugImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android:2.7'
//    // No need to add LeakCanary to the release build variant:
//    releaseImplementation 'com.squareup.leakcanary:leakcanary-android-no-op:2.7'
//}
//```
//
//The `no-op` version is a no-operation version that does nothing, which is ideal for release builds to ensure that LeakCanary is only active during development.
//
//### Step 2: Initialize LeakCanary
//
//LeakCanary 2.x and above are automatically initialized when you add the dependency; no manual code initialization is required in your `Application` class or elsewhere. This auto-initialization works for most use cases, making LeakCanary effortless to integrate.
//
//### Step 3: Triggering LeakCanary and Receiving Notifications
//
//Once LeakCanary is added to your project, it starts monitoring your application for memory leaks automatically. Here's what typically happens:
//
//1. **Activity Memory Leak Example**:
//- Suppose you have an `Activity` that accidentally keeps a reference to a `Context` or a `View` after the activity is destroyed. For example, static references to a `Context` can cause leaks.
//
//```kotlin
//class ExampleActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
//    companion object {
//        // Bad practice: Static context reference can cause memory leaks
//        var staticView: View? = null
//    }
//
//    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
//        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
//        setContentView(R.layout.activity_example)
//
//        staticView = findViewById(R.id.example_view)
//    }
//
//    override fun onDestroy() {
//        super.onDestroy()
//        // Correct practice is to clear the reference to avoid memory leaks
//        // staticView = null
//    }
//}
//```
//
//In this example, if you forget to nullify the `staticView` in `onDestroy()`, LeakCanary detects that the `View` (and indirectly the `Activity`) is not properly garbage collected after the activity is destroyed.
//
//2. **Receiving Notifications**:
//- When a memory leak is detected, LeakCanary automatically captures a heap dump, analyzes it, and then sends a notification to your device.
//- Tapping the notification opens the LeakCanary activity, showing detailed information about the memory leak, including the class name of the leaked instance, the chain of references holding it, and suggestions on how to fix the leak.
//
//### Best Practices for Leak Detection
//
//- **Regularly Check**: Regularly run your app and perform typical user actions to trigger activity recreations and background processes. Check for notifications from LeakCanary to catch and address leaks early.
//- **Analyze Leaks**: Carefully read LeakCanary’s analysis to understand what is causing the leak. The path to GC root in the leak trace gives you exact pointers to the culprit in your code.
//- **Fix and Test**: Once you identify a potential leak, make appropriate code changes to remove unwanted references and then retest to ensure the issue is resolved.
//
//By following these steps, you set up a powerful mechanism to automatically detect and alert you of memory leaks in your Android application during development, helping you to maintain better performance and stability of your app.
