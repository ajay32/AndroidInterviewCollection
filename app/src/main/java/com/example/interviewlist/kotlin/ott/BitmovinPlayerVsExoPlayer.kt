//2. **Complexity**: With its wide array of features, the setup and maintenance of Bitmovin can be more complex compared to simpler, open-source alternatives.
//
//### ExoPlayer
//**ExoPlayer** is an open-source, application-level media player for Android, developed by Google. It’s widely used for its performance and adaptability, especially in Android applications.
//

//

//
//### Comparison
