// Question: Does this code follow good practice by calling setUp() inside the apply block? Why or why not?
class Configuration {
    var host: String = "localhost"
    var port: Int = 8080
    fun setUp() {
        println("Configuring server on $host:$port")
    }
}

fun main() {
    val config = Configuration().apply {
        host = "127.0.0.1"
        setUp()
    }
}

//Output -> Configuring server on 127.0.0.1:8080

//The practice of calling the `setUp()` method inside the `apply` block in your given code snippet can be seen from two perspectives, depending on the intended design and architecture of your application. Here's a detailed analysis:
//
//### Context of `setUp()` Method
//
//The `setUp()` method in this context appears to be used for printing or logging the current configuration of a `Configuration` object. This might not be the primary intended use of such a method in a production environment. Typically, a `setUp()` method might be expected to perform initialization tasks that are critical for the object's state or its interactions with other parts of a system.
//
//### Analyzing the Use of `setUp()` Inside `apply`
//
//**Pros:**
//- **Convenience:** Using `setUp()` inside `apply` ensures that the configuration and initialization steps are grouped neatly together, which can simplify the readability and flow of the code.
//- **Encapsulation:** It encapsulates the behavior related to object configuration within a single block, making it easier to manage.
//
//**Cons:**
//- **Side Effects:** If `setUp()` does more than just print settings — such as initializing network connections, preparing environment settings, or other side effects — calling it within `apply` might lead to unexpected behavior, especially if `apply` is primarily used for setting properties. This could make the code harder to debug or test because the `apply` block would be doing more than just configuring properties.
//- **Reusability and Clarity:** By including critical setup logic inside an `apply` block, you potentially reduce the clarity and reusability of the `setUp()` method. It might not be clear to other developers (or in future code reviews) that `setUp()` needs to be called to fully initialize the object if they instantiate `Configuration` elsewhere without the `apply` block.
//
//### Best Practice Considerations
//
//Calling `setUp()` within the `apply` block can be fine if:
//- The method is lightweight and closely related to setting object properties.
//- There are no significant side effects that complicate the object's state beyond simple configuration.
//
//However, it is generally advisable to separate configuration (setting properties) from initialization (preparing the object based on those properties) in most cases. This separation enhances modularity, makes the code easier to maintain, and improves readability by clearly defining what happens during object creation versus what happens when the object is being prepared for use in the application.
//
//### Conclusion
//
//In your scenario, if `setUp()` simply logs or prints the configuration, it's relatively harmless but might be better placed outside the `apply` for clarity and to adhere to the principle of single responsibility. If `setUp()` involves more complex initialization logic, it definitely should be called outside of `apply` to separate configuration from initialization actions, making the code more modular and testable.
//
//Thus, while technically feasible and sometimes convenient, calling `setUp()` inside `apply` is not strictly following best practices unless it is part of a deliberate and clear design choice.
