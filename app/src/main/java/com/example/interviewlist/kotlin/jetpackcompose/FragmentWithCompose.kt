//In Jetpack Compose, you typically do not use traditional Android fragments directly within composable functions, as Compose provides a more direct and efficient way to manage UI components and their lifecycles. Jetpack Compose is designed to replace the traditional view system, including fragments, with a more flexible and cohesive approach using composables.
//
//However, if you need to integrate existing fragment-based code with Jetpack Compose or require specific features provided by fragments (like using advanced navigation features, interacting with older parts of an app that use fragments, or utilizing fragment lifecycle methods), there are ways to bridge the two:
//
//### Using Fragments to Host Compose UI
//You can use a fragment as a container for your composables. This method allows you to gradually migrate an app to Jetpack Compose without rewriting all existing fragment-based architecture at once.
//
//Hereâ€™s how you can set up a fragment to host a Composable UI:
//

//class ComposeFragment : Fragment() {
//    override fun onCreateView(
//        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
//        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
//    ): View {
//        return ComposeView(requireContext()).apply {
//            setContent {
//                MyComposable()
//            }
//        }
//    }
//}
//
//@Composable
//fun MyComposable() {
//    Text("Hello from Compose inside a Fragment!")
//}
//```
//
//In this example, `ComposeView` is used within a fragment to display composable content, allowing you to utilize Compose for the UI while still leveraging fragment features.
//
//### Embedding Fragments in Compose Layouts
//If you absolutely need to embed a traditional fragment within a Compose layout (for example, to reuse a complex fragment that has not been rewritten in Compose), you can use `AndroidView` or the Accompanist library's `FragmentHost` composable. However, embedding fragments inside Compose is generally not recommended because it can lead to complex code and performance issues.
//
//Here's how you could technically do it using Accompanist:
//
//First, add Accompanist to your project:
//
//```gradle
//dependencies {
//    implementation "com.google.accompanist:accompanist-navigation-material:<version>"
//}
//```
//
//Then, use `FragmentHost` in your composable:
//

//@Composable
//fun FragmentContainerExample() {
//    FragmentHost(fragment = { MyFragment() })
//}
//```
//
//This method should be used sparingly and primarily as a temporary solution while transitioning from a traditional fragment-based UI to a fully composable-based UI.
//
//### Conclusion
//While you can integrate fragments and composables, Jetpack Compose is intended to simplify and improve UI development on Android, often eliminating the need for fragments. It's generally better to transition towards using Compose entirely for UI designs where possible, using fragments to host composables during a transition period or when necessary for utilizing specific legacy functionalities within a Compose-based application.
