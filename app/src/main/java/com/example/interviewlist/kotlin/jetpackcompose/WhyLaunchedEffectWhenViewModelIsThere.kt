//`LaunchedEffect` and `rememberCoroutineScope` are provided in Jetpack Compose for handling side effects and managing coroutine execution within the composable functions. They are indeed meant for certain types of operations, but not typically for data fetching that involves business logic or data that should survive configuration changes—those scenarios are best handled by a ViewModel. Let’s break down the purpose of each and how they fit into the broader architecture.
//
//### LaunchedEffect
//`LaunchedEffect` is used for launching coroutines in a composable function that need to run and potentially complete without blocking the UI thread. It is particularly useful for:
//
//- **Side effects that are lifecycle-aware**: If you need to perform an operation when your composable appears on screen and ensure it stops if the composable is removed, `LaunchedEffect` is appropriate. This could include starting animations, subscribing to a flow, or logging events.
//- **Operations tied to specific keys**: You can pass keys to `LaunchedEffect`, and if any of the keys change, the current coroutine is cancelled and restarted. This is useful for tasks that need to re-run when specific data changes.
//
//However, for long-running data fetches that should persist beyond the lifecycle of the composable (like surviving configuration changes), `LaunchedEffect` is not typically recommended.
//
//### rememberCoroutineScope
//`rememberCoroutineScope` gives you access to a CoroutineScope tied to the lifecycle of the composable where it's used. This is used when:
//
//- **Launching tasks in response to user interactions**: Such as loading more data when a user clicks a button or triggering a one-off operation that doesn’t need to survive past the composable’s removal.
//- **Controlling coroutine execution**: It provides more control over when coroutines are launched and canceled, independent of composables recomposing, which is not something directly achievable with `LaunchedEffect`.
//
//### Example Uses
//Here's a simple illustration of how each might be used:
//
//```kotlin
//@Composable
//fun UserProfile(id: String) {
//    val viewModel: UserProfileViewModel = viewModel()
//    LaunchedEffect(id) {
//        viewModel.loadUserData(id)
//    }
//    // UI code that observes LiveData or StateFlow from ViewModel
//}
//
//@Composable
//fun TriggerHappyButton() {
//    val scope = rememberCoroutineScope()
//    Button(onClick = {
//        scope.launch {
//            // Perform an action when button is clicked, like showing a snackbar
//        }
//    }) {
//        Text("Click me!")
//    }
//}
//```
//
//### Why Not Fetch Data in Composables?
//While you can initiate data fetches with these tools, they should generally be used for operations that are purely related to UI concerns or temporary effects, and not for fetching or managing data that is critical to the application’s state or business logic. Data management and fetching should be handled by ViewModels to take advantage of their lifecycle management and the cleaner architecture they promote. ViewModel helps you keep your UI code simpler and more focused, and it makes testing easier.
//
//### Conclusion
//`LaunchedEffect` and `rememberCoroutineScope` offer powerful tools for managing coroutines within the lifecycle of composables. They are designed to handle scenarios where operations need to be closely tied to the UI's lifecycle, or triggered directly by user interactions. However, they are not replacements for a ViewModel when it comes to managing and maintaining data across the lifecycle of your entire app or its substantial parts.
