//Supporting multi-screen devices, such as foldable phones or dual-screen devices like the Microsoft Surface Duo, as well as in-car entertainment systems with multiple displays, involves understanding how Android manages screen configurations and adapting your application to handle these efficiently. This scenario is becoming more relevant with the growing variety of Android-powered devices available on the market.
//
//### Handling Multi-Screen Devices in Android
//
//#### 1. **Adapting to Foldables and Dual-Screen Devices**
//
//Android developers need to consider several aspects when adapting applications for foldable and dual-screen devices:
//
//- **Screen Continuity**: Your app should handle the folding and unfolding actions seamlessly. This involves maintaining the app's state and contents consistently as the device configuration changes.
//
//- **Multi-Window Support**: Ensure your app supports multi-window mode, allowing users to use the app in split-screen mode, which is a common feature in foldable and dual-screen devices.
//
//- **Responsive Design**: Utilize flexible layouts that can adapt to varying screen sizes and orientations. `ConstraintLayout` is particularly useful here.
//
//- **Configuration Changes**: Handle configuration changes properly to adjust layouts and resources without losing state.
//
//**Example Handling for Foldable Devices:**
//
//When dealing with foldable devices, consider using the Jetpack WindowManager library, which provides tools to determine the hinge location and posture of foldable devices.
//
//```kotlin
//dependencies {
//    implementation "androidx.window:window-java:1.x.x" // Check for the latest version
//}
//
//// Usage within an Activity or Fragment:
//val windowInfoRepository = WindowInfoTracker.getOrCreate(this)
//
//LifecycleEventObserver { _, event ->
//    if (event == Lifecycle.Event.ON_RESUME) {
//        windowInfoRepository.windowLayoutInfo(this).collect { layoutInfo ->
//            for (displayFeature in layoutInfo.displayFeatures) {
//                val foldingFeature = displayFeature as? FoldingFeature
//                if (foldingFeature != null && foldingFeature.occlusionType == FoldingFeature.OcclusionType.FULL) {
//                    // The device has a fold that might occlude content. Adjust layout accordingly.
//                }
//            }
//        }
//    }
//}
//```
//
//#### 2. **Supporting Multiple Devices in Cars**
//
//In-car entertainment systems may involve multiple displays or unique configurations. When developing for automotive systems, you might need to handle:
//
//- **Multi-Display Support**: Android Automotive OS supports multi-display setups. Apps can run simultaneously on different screens (e.g., one for navigation and one for media playback).
//
//- **Audio Focus**: Manage audio focus carefully, as multiple apps might attempt to play sounds.
//
//- **User Interface**: Design your UI to be clear and accessible, considering drivers' quick glanceability and safety.
//
//**Example Handling for Multi-Display in Cars:**
//
//To launch an activity on a secondary display in a car:
//
//```kotlin
//val displayManager = context.getSystemService(Context.DISPLAY_SERVICE) as DisplayManager
//val displays = displayManager.displays // Get all available displays
//
//if (displays.size > 1) {
//    val secondaryDisplay = displays[1] // Assuming the second display is the target
//
//    val options = ActivityOptions.makeBasic()
//    options.launchDisplayId = secondaryDisplay.displayId
//
//    val intent = Intent(context, MySecondaryActivity::class.java)
//    context.startActivity(intent, options.toBundle())
//}
//```
//
//### Testing and Best Practices
//
//- **Testing**: Test your application on real devices if possible, or use emulators that support foldable or dual-screen setups. For automotive apps, use the Automotive OS emulator.
//
//- **Best Practices**: Follow the official Android guidelines for multi-screen and automotive apps. Ensure that your app remains functional and efficient across various device configurations.
//
//- **Documentation**: Keep up with Android's official documentation and community forums for updates on best practices and new features related to multi-screen and automotive applications.
//
//By considering these factors and implementing appropriate features, you can ensure that your Android application provides a seamless and efficient user experience across a variety of modern devices.
