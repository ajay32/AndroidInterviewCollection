// memory leaks in kotlin android and lets detect it without using leak canary

//Detecting memory leaks in Android without using specialized tools like LeakCanary can be more challenging but certainly possible. It requires a more manual approach to understanding how references are held and managed within your application. Here are some strategies you can employ to identify potential memory leaks in a Kotlin Android app:
//
//### 1. **Using Android Studio's Profiler**
//
//Android Studio includes built-in tools that can help identify memory leaks:
//
//- **Memory Profiler**: You can use the Memory Profiler to monitor the memory usage of your application in real-time. Look for the following signs:
//- **Memory usage that consistently rises and does not drop back down** after certain actions are completed could indicate a leak.
//- **Heap dumps**: You can manually trigger heap dumps in the profiler and inspect them. Look for objects that have more instances than expected, and check their reference chains to see why they're being retained.
//
//- **Analyze Heap Dumps**:
//- Capture a heap dump by clicking on the "Dump Java Heap" icon in the Memory Profiler while your app is running.
//- Use the "Analyzer Tasks" in Android Studio to inspect the heap dump. Look for activities, fragments, or other objects that should have been garbage collected but are still retained.
//
//### 2. **Manual Tracking**
//
//- **Logging and Monitoring**: Implement logging in your `onDestroy()` or cleanup methods for activities, fragments, or other components. Check whether these methods are called as expected when the component should be destroyed. Persistent components that should be gone could indicate a leak.
//
//- **Override `finalize()`**:
//- You can override the `finalize()` method on suspect objects to log when they are garbage collected. If you notice the finalize method is not being called when it should be, you might have a memory leak.
//```kotlin
//class MyActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
//
//    override fun finalize() {
//        Log.d("MyActivity", "finalize: This object is being garbage collected")
//        super.finalize()
//    }
//}
//```
//Note: Use this method sparingly as relying on `finalize()` is generally not recommended due to its unpredictability and potential to introduce other problems.
//
//### 3. **Code Review and Best Practices**
//
//- **Review Lifecycle Implementations**: Ensure that all your components (activities, fragments, services) properly manage their lifecycles, unregistering listeners, observers, and other callbacks in their respective `onPause()`, `onStop()`, or `onDestroy()` methods.
//
//- **Avoid Static References**: Static references to contexts, views, or other objects tied to activity lifecycles can easily lead to leaks. Always clear static references when the activity or view is destroyed.
//
//- **Use Weak References**: When you need to hold references to objects that may outlive an activity (like callbacks or listeners), use `WeakReference` or `java.lang.ref.WeakReference`. This allows the referenced object to be garbage collected even while your reference still exists.
//```kotlin
//class Example {
//    private var callback: WeakReference<Callback>? = null
//
//    fun setCallback(callback: Callback) {
//        this.callback = WeakReference(callback)
//    }
//}
//```
//
//### 4. **Testing with Configuration Changes**
//
//- **Force Configuration Changes**: Memory leaks commonly occur around configuration changes (like screen rotations). Force these changes while monitoring memory usage to see if there's a noticeable increase that doesn't subside.
//
//### Conclusion
//
//While tools like LeakCanary significantly simplify the process of detecting memory leaks, using Android Studioâ€™s built-in tools, carefully managing object lifecycles, and employing best practices in coding can also help you manage and reduce memory leaks. Regular profiling and attentive development practices are key to maintaining a healthy, efficient application.
