What happens if you don’t provide a constructor in a class?
If you don’t provide a constructor in a class in Java,
the compiler automatically generates a default constructor with no arguments and no operation which is a default constructor.


How many types of constructors are used in Java?
There are two types of constructors in Java as mentioned below:

Default Constructor
Parameterized Constructor
Default Constructor: It is the type that does not accept any parameter value. It is used to set initial values for object attributes.

class_Name();
// Default constructor called


Parameterized Constructor: It is the type of constructor that accepts parameters as arguments. These are used to assign values to instance variables during the initialization of objects.

class_Name(parameter1, parameter2......);
// All the values passed as parameter will be
// allocated accordingly
