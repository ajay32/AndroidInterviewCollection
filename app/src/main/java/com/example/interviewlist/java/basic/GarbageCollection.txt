How does garbage collection work in Java?
In Java, the Virtual Machine (JVM) manages memory through automatic garbage collection (GC). This process identifies and reclaims objects that are no longer in use.

Key Concepts
Reachability: Objects are considered "alive" if they are reachable from the root object, which can be a Thread, Stack, or Static reference. Unreachable objects are eligible for garbage collection.

Reference Types: There are different reference types that play a role in determining an object's reachability and GC eligibility.

Reference Types
Strong References: The most common type, created with Object obj = new Object(). Objects with strong references are not eligible for GC.

Soft References: Denoted by SoftReference<Object> softRef = new SoftReference<>(obj). Soft-referenced objects are garbage-collected only if the JVM requires memory.

Weak References: Created with WeakReference<Object> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(obj). These objects are reclaimed during the next GC cycle if they are not reachable.

Phantom References: Rarely used, these are created using PhantomReference, typically in conjunction with a ReferenceQueue. They are enqueued before being collected during the next GC cycle.

Finalization: The GC process can finalize an object before it reclaims it. This capability is associated with finalize() method, allowing the object to perform any necessary cleanup actions before being garbage-collected.

Code example: Different types of references
Here is the Java code:

import java.lang.ref.*;

public class ReferenceTypes {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = new Object();  // Strong Reference
        SoftReference<Object> softRef = new SoftReference<>(obj);  // Soft Reference
        WeakReference<Object> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(obj);  // Weak Reference

        PhantomReference<Object> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<>(obj, new ReferenceQueue<>());  // Phantom Reference
        obj = null;  // obj is no longer a strong reference to the object, making it eligible for garbage collection
    }
}
Interview Tips
Each reference type caters to specific memory management requirements. Understanding their use-cases is crucial for efficient resource utilization.

The finalize() method, while still available, is considered obsolete. Its use is generally discouraged due to potential performance and reliability concerns.

Familiarize yourself with more modern memory management tools, such as java.lang.ref.Cleaner, introduced in Java 9, for effective resource management in better ways.
