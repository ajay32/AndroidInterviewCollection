What are the main features of Java?
Java's robustness makes it stand out with its powerful features.

Core Features of Java
Platform Independence: Write once, run anywhere (WORA) through Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Object-Oriented Design: Emphasizes on objects and classes, promoting encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Strong Typing: Variables are strongly typed, reducing ambiguity and potential for errors.

Security: Offers a secure platform with features such as a bytecode verifier and a security manager.

Memory Management: Centralized memory allocation and automatic garbage collection, reducing the risk of memory leaks.

Concurrency: Multi-threading, enabling concurrent execution and efficient multitasking.

Architecture-Neutrality: Promotes scalability in terms of hardware and software configurations.

Dynamic Linking: Modules can be loaded on-the-fly if needed, enhancing flexibility.

Simplicity: Easy-to-learn syntax and standard libraries simplify software development.

Portability: Java's "compile once, run anywhere" philosophy enables it to function across diverse platforms.

JIT Compilation: Combines the flexibility of bytecode with the performance of machine code.
