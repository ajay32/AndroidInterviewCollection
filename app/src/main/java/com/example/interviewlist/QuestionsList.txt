Kotlin Interviews question

1. Functional interface in kotlin
2. Find duplicate char in String = “furniture”
3. Write latent and lazy
4. Facade pattern
5. What design patterns you have implemented in android
6. Show the code and tell the code flow
but tell me when we use viewmodel in android with jetpack compose we use state flow or live data ...are not they hot flow ? but u said above for api calls we should use cold flow
1. How to write Glide library - how it optimise images.. suppose we are directly adding the images to recyleview and loading tons of data.. of if we are using glide how it is optimising the images
2. Write a mock api . We are pulling the api till it is returning true and we are exiting the loop when it is returning false (you can take a math.random fun to make to return true or false)
3. Hold vs cold flow
4. How we handle exception in coroutine
5. Convert a launch coroutines to async
6. ,,where should I store api keys in android
7. Use of multi dex
8. Can a apply scope fun return a different object ex. Apply
9. PIP mode
10. Can scope fun returns different result than what they actually does now
11. What are the challenges you have faced so far in your android development career

How to change the state of array
Input Array[10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 75],
K=2 -> [70, 75, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
K=3 -> [60, 70, 75, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

//============
Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Example 1:
Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:
Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

Difference between Dispatchers Default and Dispacter IO
IO dispatcher is optimized for I/O-bound operations such as network requests, file operations, and database interactions.
he Default dispatcher is ideal for CPU-bound tasks and computationally intensive operations

Object vs companion object

Why we sharing data to UI using stateFlow, why not using LiveData or Sharedflow or flow

So you created EventBus ..so if u have two actives sharing the event bus. Both will receive the events.. but I require only in 1 activity

You wrote the viewModel object in GallerySceen but what if I have to share the ViewModel object muliple composable screens and also require in main activity to do some work ..where would you define the viewModel object

Corouties .. why u use viewModelScope … why not other way .. write coroutine without viewModelScope in  ViewMOdel..not global Scope ,

Scenario Based .. PS
Practical -

Practice access. Modifiers in Kotlin with code examples class A {
    fun callMethods() {
        internalMethod()
    }

    internal fun internalMethod() {
        println("Internal Method Called")
        privateMethod()
    }

    private fun privateMethod() {
        println("Private Method Called")
        protectedMethod()
    }

    protected fun protectedMethod() {
        println("Protected Method Called")
    }
}
fun main() {
    val a = A()
    a. internalMethod()
 a. privateMethod()
a. protectedMethod()
} now tell me the output  when you implemented all the security measure like ssl pinning encryption dec.. in details you have to tell at low level

Implement a function to check if a given string is a palindrome in Kotlin? “Mirror”, radar


Implement a function to reverse an array of integers in-place using Kotlin?

Add why to every world like ViewModelScrope.launch -> why we used viewModelscope
Why we used .launch


Why did not you use dispatcher.io in ViewModel

viewModelScope.launch {
    _state.update { currentState ->
        currentState.copy(isLoading = true) }
    _state.value.copy(isLoading = true)
    repository.searchGallery(query).onLeft { error ->
        val errorMessage = error.statusCode?.takeIf { it != 0 }
            ?.let { "${error.error.message} Code: $it" } ?: error.error.message

        _state.update { it.copy(error = errorMessage) }

        sendEvent(Event.Toast(errorMessage))

    }.onRight { galleryItems ->
        _state.update { it.copy(galleryItemList = galleryItems) }
    }

    _state.update { it.copy(isLoading = false) }
}


Can we use viewModelScope.async .. how will it effect the code

Is viewModel is a supervisor job ?

Why we need cold flow in android
We got data in activity then we go back and come again… we want to changed data..in this situation do we need cold flow or hot flow ?

Will it print  fun main() {

    GlobalScope.async {

        println("If i print something here")


    }


}


From the interview I got 2 serious things —>

See code in single page and from the angle of thread is it main thread of background thread
Like I could not able to differentiate if my api is getting called on main thread or background thread

2 . viewModelScope.launch  is a supervisor job or not… there could be line 5 uses cases for hitting an api why don’t I know the use of supervisor code in use of hitting the api or for async task.. I need to create use cases for asynchronous tasks and match all the coroutine scope with it

http://localhost:3000/


Reverse a string without reversed function
You know scope function .. use apply and update name .. create a person data class
Activity mode single top , single task , single instance
Swap two numbers using the mutable list  using the extension function


//fun main() {
//
//
//    val numbers  = listOf(1,2,3)
//
//    numbers.swap(0, 2)

//}

//fun MutableList<T>.swap(indexA: Int, indexB: Int) {
//
//    var temp = this[indexA]
//    this.[indexA = indexB
//    indexB = indexA
//
//}

Clean architrecture how it works

viewModelScope.launch —> how it will handle exception  If one coroutine fails
Does another child will also fail

And also make them force update to latest version
