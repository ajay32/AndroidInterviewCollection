//Garbage collection (GC) in Kotlin works similarly to other JVM-based languages like Java because Kotlin, when targeting the JVM, runs on the Java Virtual Machine. The garbage collector's primary role is to automatically manage memory by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use, which prevents memory leaks and reduces the program's footprint.
//
//### Understanding Garbage Collection in JVM:
//
//#### 1. **Memory Management**:
//The JVM divides memory mainly into two areas: Heap and Non-Heap memory. The heap memory is where the garbage collector operates and where objects are allocated. Non-heap memory is used for Java's runtime classes and methods.
//
//#### 2. **Heap Structure**:
//The heap is further subdivided into:
//- **Young Generation**: Where new objects are allocated. It is further divided into one 'Eden' space and two 'Survivor' spaces (S0 and S1).
//- **Old Generation (Tenured Generation)**: Where objects that have survived for a longer time in the young generation are moved.
//- **Permanent Generation (or Metaspace in newer versions of Java)**: This area stores class metadata and is generally collected less frequently than the young or old generations.
//
//#### 3. **Garbage Collection Process**:
//- **Minor GC**: Happens when the young generation fills up. This is a relatively fast process and deals mostly with removing short-lived objects.
//- **Major GC (Full GC)**: Involves cleaning the old generation and is usually more time-consuming than minor GCs. A full GC runs less frequently but is more intensive, often involving a stop-the-world event, where all application threads are paused.
//
//### Garbage Collection in Kotlin:
//When you write Kotlin code that targets the JVM, the behavior of garbage collection does not differ from Java because Kotlin uses the same object model and memory allocation techniques. Here are some specifics:
//
//#### Kotlin and Java Interoperability:
//- **Kotlin Objects**: Objects in Kotlin behave the same as Java objects concerning garbage collection. For instance, if you create a Kotlin class, instances of this class are subject to the same GC processes as instances of a Java class.
//- **Null Safety Features**: Kotlin's type system has built-in null safety that is absent in Java. However, this does not directly impact how GC works, but it helps in reducing null-pointer exceptions and potentially the creation of unnecessary objects.
//
//#### Kotlin on Other Platforms:
//- **Kotlin/Native**: Uses a different memory management approach, which includes reference counting combined with a cyclic garbage collector to collect cyclic references. This means that while JVM-based Kotlin uses the Java Garbage Collector, Kotlin/Native handles memory management without relying on a traditional GC mechanism used by the JVM.
//- **Kotlin/JS**: When compiling to JavaScript, Kotlin's memory management and garbage collection are delegated to the JavaScript engine's garbage collector.
//
//### Best Practices for Memory Management in Kotlin:
//- **Avoid Memory Leaks**: Although Kotlin's null safety can help prevent certain types of memory leaks, you should still be careful with contexts, listeners, and inner class references, especially in Android development.
//- **Understand Object Lifecycles**: Especially in Android, managing the lifecycle of objects and freeing up resources when they are no longer needed can help in reducing the impact on garbage collection and overall memory usage.
//
//In summary, while Kotlin offers many improvements and syntactic sugar over Java, the fundamental workings of garbage collection in Kotlin on the JVM are identical to Java due to their shared platform. The differences in memory management become more apparent when using Kotlin/Native or Kotlin/JS, as these target different runtime environments with different garbage collection mechanisms.

//==============================================

// On which thread garbage collector runs ?


//The garbage collector (GC) in Java, and by extension in JVM-based languages like Kotlin, typically runs on its own threads, which are managed by the JVM. These threads are separate from the application threads and are specifically dedicated to the garbage collection process.
//
//### Key Points About Garbage Collector Threads:
//
//1. **Background Operation**: Garbage collection usually occurs in the background, meaning that it is generally handled by background threads that the JVM creates and manages specifically for garbage collection tasks.
//
//2. **Concurrent vs. Stop-the-World**: Modern garbage collectors like the Concurrent Mark Sweep (CMS), Garbage-First (G1), and the more recent Z Garbage Collector (ZGC) and Shenandoah GC are designed to perform most of their work concurrently with the application threads. This means they do not need to stop the application threads entirely to clean up garbage, reducing pause times and improving application performance. However, some operations, particularly in older or simpler garbage collectors like the Serial and Parallel collectors, may still require stopping all application threads temporarily (Stop-the-World pauses) to perform certain tasks like compacting the heap.
//
//3. **Thread Prioritization**: The threads used by the garbage collector can have different priorities, and these can be adjusted (sometimes by JVM arguments) to allocate more or fewer CPU resources to the garbage collection processes. This adjustment helps in tuning the performance of both the GC and the application according to specific needs.
//
//4. **Impact on Application Performance**: The operation of these GC threads can influence the overall performance of an application, particularly if the garbage collection becomes a bottleneck. This can happen if there is excessive garbage being generated, or if the heap size is not adequately configured, leading to frequent and lengthy garbage collection cycles.
//
//### Managing Garbage Collection:
//
//While developers do not have direct control over the GC threads themselves, they can influence garbage collection behavior through various JVM arguments and settings, such as:
//- **Choosing the Garbage Collector**: Selecting the right GC algorithm based on application needs (e.g., G1 for applications needing large heaps with short GC pauses).
//- **Heap Size Settings**: Adjusting the maximum and initial heap sizes with `-Xms` and `-Xmx`.
//- **GC Tuning Parameters**: Fine-tuning with flags specific to the chosen GC, like `-XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC` for CMS or `-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200` for setting desired pause times.
//
//### Example JVM Arguments for GC Tuning:
//
//Here is an example of setting JVM arguments to tune garbage collection:
//
//```bash
//java -Xms512m -Xmx1024m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200 -jar MyApplication.jar
//```
//
//This command sets the initial (`-Xms`) and maximum (`-Xmx`) heap sizes and selects the G1 GC (`-XX:+UseG1GC`) while aiming to keep GC pauses under 200 milliseconds (`-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200`).
//
//Understanding how the garbage collector works and how its threads operate is crucial for optimizing the performance of applications running on the JVM, especially for applications with high throughput and low-latency requirements.]
